Your customer-service performance is measured using what we call an Order Defect Rate ( ODR ) . Your ODR is the percentage of your orders with one or more indicators of poor customer service . That could be negative customer feedback or a credit-card chargeback . We require sellers to maintain an ODR under 1 % . Looking for help with customer service ?
