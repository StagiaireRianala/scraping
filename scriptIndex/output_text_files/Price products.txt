  - Before you set prices for your products, you’ll want to get familiar with key concepts we use to organize and support pricing in the Amazon store.
  - Competitive external price: the lowest price for an item from major retailers outside Amazon. We share competitive external prices with sellers. For your own price to be considered competitive, your standard item price, plus shipping, must be less than or equal to the competitive external price.
  - Featured Offer: the offer a customer often sees near the top of a product detail page with ‘Buy Now’ and ‘Add to Cart’ buttons. To compete for the Featured Offer, a seller must set a competitive price and have a Professional selling plan. The product also needs to be in new condition.
  - Lowest Amazon price: the lowest price currently offered by a seller in the Amazon store. We share the current lowest Amazon price to give sellers who list a product to the opportunity to match or beat it.
