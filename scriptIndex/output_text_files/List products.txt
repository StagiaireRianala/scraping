Contenus :

Titre : Make sure your products are safe and compliant
Contenus :
    - Customers trust that they can always buy with confidence in the Amazon store. Products offered for sale in the Amazon store must comply with all laws and regulations, as well as Amazon policies. Before you start the listing process, make sure your understand our Product safety and Restricted products policies.

Titre : Find or obtain a product ID (GTIN)
Contenus :
    - The primary tool we use to pair a seller’s offer with the correct product detail page is a product ID, also called a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). It can often be found on packaging above or below the product’s barcode. The most common GTIN used by Amazon sellers is a UPC, but you might also find an ISBN, EAN, or JAN on your product.

In some cases, you might need to obtain a GTIN for a product from Global Standards 1. In rare cases, you might apply for a GTIN exemption from Amazon.

Titre : Match or create a product listing
Contenus :
    - If the product you want to sell is already in the Amazon store, you can use its GTIN to match an offer to the existing product detail page. If a product isn’t already in the Amazon store, you’ll need to create a new product detail page and can add your offer information simultaneously.

All sellers can match or create product listings one at a time. Professional sellers can also match or create product listings in bulk.

Your ability to list a product in the Amazon store can depend on its category, condition, and brand. In some cases, you’ll need to apply to sell a product, category, or brand. You’ll be prompted to do so during the listing process.

    - If a product is part of a brand enrolled in Amazon Brand Registry, only three types of sellers can create its product detail page using our standard listing processes:
    - the original rights owner who enrolled the brand
    - other sellers internal to the brand
    - resellers who’ve been associated with the brand
    - After a product is listed by one of the above sellers, others sellers can match offers to its product detail page. They may be prompted to complete a brand selling application first.
    - the original rights owner who enrolled the brand
    - other sellers internal to the brand
    - resellers who’ve been associated with the brand
    - Every product in the Amazon store is automatically assigned an ASIN, or Amazon Standard Identification Number. This number is different from a GTIN and SKU. If you don’t have a GTIN for a product, you can try to match an offer to an existing product detail page using its ASIN instead.
